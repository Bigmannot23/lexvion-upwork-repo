Want to move leads from cold to closed faster without dropping the ball? I create a custom **Sales Workflow SOP** that outlines your outreach and follow‑up process step by step, so any team member can execute it. We start with a simple intake to capture your goals, offer and tools. I then map out each action, add AI prompts for email drafting, and weave in proven follow‑up timing. Signature elements include a **10‑Tag Lead Status** taxonomy (New, Warm, Hot, Follow‑up‑1, Follow‑up‑2, Nurture, No‑Reply, Meeting, Won, Lost) and a **micro‑cadence schedule** (Day 0, 2, 5, 9) so you know exactly when to nudge prospects. You’ll be able to track each lead’s status at a glance and stick to a simple schedule that maximizes replies. The finished SOP is concise (2–4 pages) and comes with a one‑page Quick‑Start checklist and a short walkthrough script for onboarding. This project provides documentation/training only—no automation or tool setup. For $25 you get a two‑day turnaround and one focused revision. Save time, increase replies and scale your sales process with clarity.
