**10‑Tag Lead Status taxonomy:** A ready‑to‑use list of lead statuses (New, Warm, Hot, Follow‑up‑1, Follow‑up‑2, Nurture, No‑Reply, Meeting, Won, Lost) so your team always knows the next step.

**Micro‑cadence schedule:** A four‑touch cadence (Day 0, 2, 5, 9) that tells you exactly when to follow up to maximize replies without overdoing it.
