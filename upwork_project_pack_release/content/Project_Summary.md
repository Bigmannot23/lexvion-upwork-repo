Feeling overwhelmed by ad‑hoc content creation? I design a custom **Content Workflow SOP** that turns your ideas into a consistent publishing machine. After a quick intake on your goals, audience and tools, I map each step from brainstorming to publishing and add AI prompts to speed up drafts. Signature elements include a **12‑Week Content Calendar** skeleton (topics, owner, due date, status) and a **1→10 Repurpose Matrix** that shows how to spin one piece into multiple assets—blogs, tweets, emails, videos and more. We’ll identify your content pillars and show how to organize them on the calendar. You’ll receive a concise 2–4 page document plus a one‑page Quick‑Start and a short walkthrough script, making it easy to onboard yourself or a teammate. This project provides documentation/training only—no automation or tool setup. By following the SOP you’ll maintain a steady flow of content, reduce scramble and reuse your best ideas across channels. Pricing is $25 with a two‑day delivery and one focused revision. This package is built for speed, clarity and real‑world impact.
