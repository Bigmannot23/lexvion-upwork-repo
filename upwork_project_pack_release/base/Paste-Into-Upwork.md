**Title:** AI Workflow SOP Builder – Clear Steps to Save Hours
**Category/Subcategory:** Writing & Translation → Other Writing & Translation
**Price:** $25
**Delivery time:** 2 days
**Revisions:** 1
**Project Summary:** Need to transform a messy process into a reliable, **AI‑optimized standard operating procedure**? I build a custom AI Workflow SOP that turns your daily tasks into a clear, repeatable system you can follow or hand to a teammate. Starting with a short intake to understand your goals and tools, I map out each step, add AI prompts and cue boxes, and integrate simple guardrails so you know what to do and what to avoid. The result is a concise document (2–4 pages) plus a one‑page Quick‑Start and a script you can read or record. You’ll save time, reduce errors and delegate with confidence. Signature elements include a **Do/Don’t Guardrails** mini‑card and a **Daily Task Triage** template that helps you prioritize tasks (Do Today, Delegate, Defer). We’ll focus on documenting your process so you can measure time saved and continuously improve. This project provides documentation/training only—no automation or tool setup. The price is fixed at $25 for a two‑day delivery with one focused revision, ensuring you get exactly what you need, quickly.
