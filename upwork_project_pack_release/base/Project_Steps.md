1) **Intake** – You share your goals, tasks and tools via a short intake.
2) **Map & Draft** – I outline each step, insert AI prompts and add Do/Don’t Guardrails.
3) **Checklist & QA** – Build a one‑page Quick‑Start and a Daily Task Triage template; refine for clarity.
4) **Review & Finalize** – You review; I apply one focused revision and deliver the final SOP package.
