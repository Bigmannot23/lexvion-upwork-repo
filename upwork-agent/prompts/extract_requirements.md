Return strict JSON with:
{ "title": "", "summary": "", "deliverables": [], "must_have": [], "nice_to_have": [], "budget": null, "timeline": null, "domain": [], "risks": [] }
Rules:
- Be concise and pragmatic.
- Derive "must_have" from explicit tech/skills in the post.
- Put ambiguity/unknowns into "risks".
- No prose outside JSON.
